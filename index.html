  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; line-height: 1.6;">
    Long ago, there was a vast network of pyramids that spanned our world, structures aligned not only with the stars but with each other, forming a planetary web of energy, intention, and knowledge. Much of this network has been lost to time, but its echoes remain, in the land, in ancient stories, and in the deep knowing that these structures served a greater purpose.

  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; max-width: 800px; margin: 30px auto; line-height: 1.6;">
    <strong>Pyramid Grid</strong> is a project to help restore this forgotten grid. As new pyramids are built and activated across the world, we track and map their locations, whether through customer installations or individual contributions. Each one becomes a node in a decentralized, living system that grows organically, powered by those who resonate with its purpose.

  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; line-height: 1.6;">
    This is not just a map, it’s a movement. A worldwide restoration effort. A fusion of ancient wisdom, sacred geometry, and modern technology. Our mission is to reconnect the Earth’s energetic architecture and empower a community dedicated to harmony, exploration, and consciousness. Learn more soon at <strong>PyramidGrid.org</strong>.
